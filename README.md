# Animal Health Surveillance Tool
The Animal Disease Prevention sector of the Swiss Federal Food Safety and Veterinary Office has developed an R-based tool to support the planning and evaluation of surveillance programmes for Infectious Bovine Rhinotracheitis (IBR) and Enzootic Bovine Leukosis (EBL) in cattle in Switzerland. This tool facilitates the precise planning of new surveillance periods, such as calculating the number of sentinel farms, and enables near real-time evaluation of surveillance results. Consequently, the annual programme can be adapted dynamically to maximise the confidence and cost-effectiveness ratio.
