# TGTS-Surveillance-IBR-EBL
The sector Animal Disease Prevention of the FSVO developped a R-based tool to support the planning and evaluation of the surveillance programme for Infectious bovine rhinotracheitis (IBR) and Enzootic bovine leukosis (EBL) in cattle in Switzerland. The tool allows to precisely plan for a new period of the surveillance programme (e.g. calculate the number of sentinel farms) and to evaluate the surveillance results close to real-time, enabling to stop the yearly programme as soon as confidence of freedom is reached.
